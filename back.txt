how the backend know if the user have this wallet - signing a message

so why auth is needed 
each time user sends username or password to the backend - its ugly

the number of requests to the database increases 
so to avoid that we use jwt, coockies so that we can maintain a session
and no need to hit the database again and again 

how cookies and jwt works?

signing a message: 
address and the signed_message is sent to the backend 

you also need to make sure in the submission that every user just makes one submission
